<Page title="Solving CoreData race conditions">

    Ever seen this error when your application using CoreData crashes?

    `fault: NULL _cd_rawData but the object is not being turned into a fault`

    This happens when you're trying to access the managed entry on a thread that the `NSManagedObjectContext` is not on.

    ## Solution

    Well this how solved it for myself.

    You'll need to have access to `NSManagedObjectContext` of the CoreData entry you're trying to access. I use singleton
    class that I can use through my app called `PersistenceController`.

    Secondly I try to determine the failure point of this race condition. Then at the point where I have access to the 
    `NSManagedObjectContext` and the Coredata entry I wrap this point in the following.

    ```swift
    await PersistenceController.shared.context.perform {
        // whatever code you where performing
    }
    ```

    Now that I'm performing the action I wanted in the `perform` block, I can safely assume that we have no more race conditions
    in this case.
