<Page title="SwiftUI macOS Edit Mode">

    So I really wanted to have the same `EditButton` when we develop our iOS apps in SwiftUI. 
    To reuse as much as possible between both platforms I got motivated to make my own implementation of
    of the `EditButton`.

    ## iOS EditMode usage

    This is what we want to implement for macOS.

    ```swift
    struct ContentView: View {
        /// Environment key to get the current 
        /// EditMode state
        @Environment(\.editMode) var editMode: EditMode

        var body: some View {
            /// Button to toggle the edit mode
            EditButton()
        }
    }
    ```

    ## EditMode model

    Let's first start of with implementing the `EditMode` model.

    ```swift
    enum EditMode {
        case active
        case inactive

        var isEditing: Bool {
            self == .active
        }
    }
    ```
