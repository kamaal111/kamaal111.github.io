<Page title="SwiftUI macOS Edit Mode" addSyntaxHighlighting>

    So I really wanted to have the same `EditButton` when we develop our iOS apps in SwiftUI. 
    To reuse as much as possible between both platforms I got motivated to make my own implementation of
    of the `EditButton`.

    ```swift
    let hallo = yes
    ```
