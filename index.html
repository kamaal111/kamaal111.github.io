        Hello I'm Kamaal, <em id="age">(probably around 25 years old)</em> years
        old. I love writing code and lifting weights 🏋.
        <br />
        I would love to code for the rest of my life. The idea of thinking of
        something and just creating it fascinates me. Lastly I tried figuring
        out how to build iOS apps and I'm having a lot of fun doing so. <br />
        Lifting weights helps me to clear brain fog so that I can stay sharp and
        sleep feeling fulfilled 💪. <br />For the past 5 years (including
        internships and summer jobs) I have been working as an electrician,
        mostly in the industry of Rotterdam. I truly want to become the best in
        my craft and I believe I can become the best in my field if I am having
        fun doing what I'm doing. And I do find writing code and solving
        problems a lot fun.
